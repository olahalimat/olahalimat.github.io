            <p> Review: This park is great for spending time with family and friends or even have an
                alone time, but the only negative stuff about this park is the fact that there are dogs everywhere,
                as someone who is not a lover of dogs, I was extremely uncomfortable and the dog owners are allowed to choose not to leash their dogs
                which I find very inconsiderate. So if you are just like me, I would recommend to look for a different park.
